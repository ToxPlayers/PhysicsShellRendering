# PhysicsShellRendering
Shell Rendering + Engine Physics
Based on Acerola implementation https://github.com/GarrettGunnell/Shell-Texturing

Added physics using a second object to simulate the forces applied to the original, and calculating the offset from the original object.
By default it's using spring joint, but can be swapped with any other method.
