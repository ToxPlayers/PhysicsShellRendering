# PhysicsShellRendering
Shell Rendering + Engine Physics
Based on Acerola implementation https://github.com/GarrettGunnell/Shell-Texturing

Added physics using a second object to simulate the forces applied, and calculating the offset from the original object.
By default it's using spring joint, but can be swapped with any other method.
