# Physics-IndirectInstanced-ShellRendering
Shell Rendering, Engine Physics with Indirect Instancing<br />
Based on Acerola implementation https://github.com/GarrettGunnell/Shell-Texturing<br />
Imported to ShaderGraph.<br />
Added physics using a second object to simulate the forces applied to the original, and calculating the offset from the original object.<br />
By default it's using spring joint, but can be swapped with any other method.<br />
Added indirect Instancing per shell group.<br />
